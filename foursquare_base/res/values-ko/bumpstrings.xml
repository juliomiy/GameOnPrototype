<!-- SPECIAL NOTES TO TRANSLATORS:  -->

<!--   Background information: These phrases are from an iPhone app called "Bump" that lets two users connect to share contact information and photos by physically bumping their two phones together.  Before starting your translation, please watch this 30-second video so you understand what this means: http://bu.mp/videos.html -->

<!--   How to treat the word "bump":  "Bump" is the name of the application and the name of our company, but it represents a physical action of bumping two phones together.  Please use the most appropriate word in your language to represent this, unless otherwise instructed. -->

<!--   *Length of your tranlsations*:  Because these phrases will appear on a mobile phone, you must keep your translations short in length so they fit in the space provided.  Please try to keep your translations shorter-than or equal-to the length of the English phrase.  If you must alter the wording to achieve this, that is OK.  -->

<!--   Special placeholders:  This file is read directly by the computer to generate the phrases in the application.  Some phrases contain special characters that represent various things.  For example, %s is used as a placeholder for another word, usually a person's name.  \n is sometimes used to represent a newline character.  If a special character placeholder appears in the English phrase, please use it in your translation in the appropriate place.  -->

<!--   How to read this file:  Each phrase listed is shown in this format: "This is the English phrase" = "This is where you put your translation</string>  Please DO NOT ALTER THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE = sign IN ANY WAY.  You will place your translation in place of the English phrase on the RIGHT-HAND SIDE of the =.  For example, "This phrase is in English" = "This phrase is now in Chinese becuase I replaced the English phrase with my translation</string>  Above each phrase, we've explained exactly how this phrase is used and included any special instructions.  Please DO NOT tranlsation these instructions :) -->

<!--   IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WHATSOEVER, PLEASE EMAIL translations@bu.mp  or call 1-650-275-2867.  We will respond within minutes unless we are asleep.  Thanks!!! :)  -->
